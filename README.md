Simple Hangman
Coded in PyCharm for Python 3.10 and tested by peers and associates alike at school.

I have developed a hangman game using Python programming language with modular functions to facilitate drawing the game on the screen. 
I have also created a separate file containing a pool of words that the game can randomly select for the user to guess.
The game allows the user to have six attempts to guess the correct word, after which the game ends and the correct word is displayed. 
The implementation of this game follows best practices in software development and adheres to industry standards for clean, efficient code.
